1 . Combine the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Slowly pour in the milk and mix well.
2 . Add the eggs, vanilla, and vegetable oil. Whisk the batter thoroughly until there are no more lumps.
3 . Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Coat with a non-stick cooking spray, butter, or vegetable oil to prevent sticking.
4 . Spoon the batter onto the pan and cook each side until it is golden brown. Use a spatula to flip the pancakes and to remove them when they are finished.
5 . Serve immediately. Add fruit, maple syrup, whipped cream, or powdered sugar if desired.
